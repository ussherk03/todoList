                <p>
                    I'm on my pen stroking, listening and picking up my strength from these self-loathing attitudes
                    That's got me sinking and soaking
                    I need a cleanup and a spark to keep my doors open
                    Gotten into many circles now my head is spinning
                    Critics, firing back and forth, but it ain't time for spitting
                    I won't wake up the beast 'cause it ain't done sleeping
                    Now Imma fire back till all bodies are hauling
                    Take a look at the streets, the condition we live in
                    Peek at the neats, and they still got no solutions
                    We love to pretend and seek our heads soft cushions
                    Ruthless bastards keep comin', and Imma dish 'em out like my sushi
                    Think of some shit to the help young ones rising
                    Take a peek at the streets, and there, you see, are walking dead meats
                    I see nothing less than crazy men and motherfucking pimps
                    Rubbish choked in every corner like there ain't no bins
                    Call me someone who wants to beef, but I don't give a fuck 'cause
                    Imma rolling up my long sleeves.
                    I just jaw you, mess you up, and have you in a bloodbath.
                    Screw me? If you knew what's cominâ€™, you'd better retreat.
                    Imma still a man of peace, but I won't settle for this shit if Ghana can't be clean
                </p>
